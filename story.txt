A UW grad student named Mike had to present at a poster session tomorrow. He decided to wait until 11PM the night before to start making his poster.  
As such, Mike stayed up until two in the morning working on his poster. Many a mountain dew was drank that night.
Mike had to get up at seven since he had a morning class. He felt so tired now
that he could not focus on the class.
